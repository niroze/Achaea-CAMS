CAMS stands for Christopher's Achaea Module System, written by
Christopher Humphries (Drauka in-game).

It's purpose is to provide an easy to code in environment using Lua
without having to mess with TF's ugly macro language. It does this by
providing a Lua based API for doing such things as adding triggers,
create aliases, and writing plugins to name a few.
