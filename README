CAMS is a system for extending functionality in TinyFugue in the Lua
programming language.

It is built to be modular and dynamic in loading of plugins, provide
all functionality needed to write modules without knowing how to code
in the TF macro language, and easy to use. CAMS is meant to be a
platform for developing on TF without TF in the way. All TF activity
is hidden and done behind the scenes through an API.

This is mainly written for geeks, but in the end it should be easy for
anyone that can follow a few instructions.
